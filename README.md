SixPair
=======

This project is aimed to be a pairing utility for the SixAxis (PS3) controller in order to be used as a joypad on pc.
Currently it is designed to work on linux (in which I tested it) with native games and with wine enabled windows games.

Works well with any bluetooth usb dongle and with integrated bluetooth modules, I configured it with KDE, and it worked.
